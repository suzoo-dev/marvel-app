I would add a create method to the controller using the Post decorator.
Within the create method argument I would add the Body decorator and expect a variable called createAccomplicesDto of type CreateAccomplicesDto.
This method would then call the create method on the service class.
The service class create method would be injected with the database client and update the accomplices table with the values on createAccomplicesDto.
